# CocoaPods Acknowledgements Add-ons

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bcylin/cocoapods-acknowledgements-addons.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bcylin/cocoapods-acknowledgements-addons)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/cocoapods-acknowledgements-addons.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/cocoapods-acknowledgements-addons)

A CocoaPods plugin that adds additional acknowledgements to the plist generated by [cocoapods-acknowledgements](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-acknowledgements).

## Installation

Install via `gem install cocoapods-acknowledgements` or add it to the **Gemfile**:

```rb
gem "cocoapods-acknowledgements-addons"
```

## Use case

If you have some dependencies installed via CocoaPods and some installed using different ways, such as [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) or git submodules, you can aggregate the acknowledgements in one place.

Use the plugin in the **Podfile**:

```rb
target :App do
  pod "CPDAcknowledgements"
end

# Generates a plist of dependencies installed via CocoaPods
plugin "cocoapods-acknowledgements"

# Adds additional acknowledgements to the generated plist
plugin "cocoapods-acknowledgements-addons", add: ["Carthage/Checkouts"]
```

The plugin searches `**/*.podspec` located in the specified directories and adds the acknowledgements to the plist generated by [cocoapods-acknowledgements](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-acknowledgements), which can be found in the `Pods` directory:

```
.
├── App.xcodeproj
├── App.xcworkspace
├── Podfile
├── Podfile.lock
└── Pods
    └── Pods-{target_name}-metadata.plist
```

> This plugin does not support the format used in `Settings.bundle` at the moment.
